### ROSbot_ROS ü§ñüöÄ

This is a fork of the ROS packages for ROSbot 2.0 and ROSbot 2.0 Pro. Additional features and improvements have been added to the original repository for testing with the [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) repository. 
These changes include:
- üêã A Dockerfile for building the ROSbot packages in a Docker container
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è A run.sh script for running the ROSbot packages in a Docker container
- üåç A couple of new worlds for the Gazebo simulation
- üìÇ A new examples folder with many examples for experimenting with the Ultralytics package

For implementing with the real robot, please use the [original repository](https://github.com/husarion/rosbot).

### Key Features

- **Versatile Examples:** The scripts located in the `examples` directory are highly adaptable, allowing you to test them in multiple environments and with a variety of sensors.
- **Simulation Support:** Compatible with popular simulation platforms including Gazebo and MuJoCo.
- **Docker Integration:** The repository is optimized for use with Docker, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup.



### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. If Docker is not already installed, follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

#### Setting Up the Docker Environment

To build and launch the Docker container, execute the following command:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This script will handle the creation and initialization of the Docker container, providing a contained and controlled environment for your testing needs.

#### Running Simulations

Once you have successfully accessed the Docker container, you can start the simulation by running:

```bash
./simulate.sh
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. **Launch Gazebo:** Launches the Gazebo simulation environment.
2. **Calls the Bringup Robot:** Initializes the robot within the simulation.
3. **Opens RViz:** Opens RViz for visualization, enabling you to observe and interact with the simulated environment.

At this stage, you are ready to test the example scripts provided in the `examples` directory.

### Example Scripts

The `examples` directory contains a variety of scripts designed to showcase different functionalities and use cases. These scripts are written to be modular and can be adapted for different sensors and environments.

```bash
cd examples
```

#### Navigation

Sitting still is boring, right? Spice things up by opening a terminal and launching:

```bash
roslaunch rosbot_navigation rosbot_teleop.launch
```

This script lets you control your ROSbot using your keyboard, turning your ideas into action in no time!


### Additional Information

- **Extensibility:** The repository is designed to be easily extendable. You can add your own models and scripts to further customize your testing environment.
- **Community Support:** If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue on the repository or reach out to the community for support.
